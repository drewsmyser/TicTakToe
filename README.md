# TicTakToe
MIT project to create a Tic Tak Toe board in React

Roadmap to future improvements:

-Adding a reset button - Adding a button would be similar to how we did in the lesson.

-Preventing a previously clicked square from being changed later (until the game is reset) - I'd do this by having the buttons' with a state set to disabled = false upon first render and the onClick would handle the event to change to disabled = true once clicked. 

-Add an alert with a reset button if the player's have a Cat's Game.
